// This is the sample on how to style the component.
// NOTE:
// 1. Always start with the same class as the root div.
// 2. This should only refer classes referred in this component
// only.
// 3. Exception: Going forward to unify style to a more T-shirt sizing
// supported by component natively.
// Now since we are not there yet. We might be ok overriding style here for
// a child. But this should be avoided as much as possible.
