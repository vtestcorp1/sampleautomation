This directory contains files related to localization within the ThoughtSpot application.

messages_codes.proto contains the definition of message codes used within components and
exposed to users.

message_codes contains the full list of all messages in the system conforming to the
definition in messages_codes.proto. All components will read this file.

For each language, we will have a message_codes file with an appropriate suffix
e.g. message_codes_fr for French.
